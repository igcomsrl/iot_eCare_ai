### Issues and New Features
We use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature additions.

### Did you discover a bug?
Do not open up a GitHub Issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in iot_eCare, and instead email developer@igcom.it.

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug (including documentation)?
Open a new GitHub Pull Request with the patch.

Ensure the Pull Request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one (including documentation)?

Do not open a Feature Request on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for Bug Reports and fixes.
